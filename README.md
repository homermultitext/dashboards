## Running dashboards locally

If you install [Julia](https://julialang.org), you can run any of the dashboards locally when you're online. (The current dashboards download a release of the HMT archive over the internet; future versions may allow you to load data from a local file.)

The dashboards expect to be started from the root directory of this repository.  You can start them from the command line or from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).


### Starting from VS Code

Make sure you have the Julia plugin installed.

1. open this repository, and find the dashboard you want to run
2. option-click anywhere in the file


### Starting from the command line

The following list of "Available Dashboards" tells you the path to each dashboard and the port it expects to run on.  You can start the dashboard with:

`julia --project="DASHBOARD_DIRECTORY" FULL_PATH/TO/DASHBOARD`

For example, you can start the `alpha-search` dashboard with

`julia --project=alpha-search alpha-search/alpha-search.jl`
